## Diurnal and Seasonal Mood Vary with Work, Sleep, and Daylength Across Diverse Cultures ([Link](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.1202775))

This research articles takes an interesting approach towards understanding mood and expression - using the power of big data acquired via online social media platforms. The paper aims to understand the diurnality and seasonality of popular mood and corroborate it with sleep, work and length of the day. This is an interesting area of study because it aims to link social expression with biological factors, and helps us understand what contributes to a positive or negative mood.  
This topic is tangential to what we've been discussing in class, albeit an important one. As we move towards more empirical studies in sociology done via the use of social media data, this is a good start to it - understanding the most basic aspect that makes us human - emotion expression.  
This paper gave a novel twist compared to the previous studies in emotion and diurnal studies in that it used large scale data across the world - different cultures, different timezones, different weekly schedules, etc., and this was helpful to pin down the hypothesis that it is biological factors and not external environmental factors (like working hours) that affect a person's mood.  
Although this paper did a great deal of novel enquiry, I feel that it lacks a few things - firstly, it doesn't explain how the users were selected and how their locales were identified. Next, the paper studies a wide variety of users - having from 25 to upto 400 tweets. We do not know the distribution of this group, and whether that affected the results seen. Lastly, the paper mentions that "night owls" have a marked difference in PA and NA rhythms, but doesn't explain what the observations were, or what their hypothesis about this is. Clarifying these questions will boost the effectiveness of the paper.  
I feel that this paper uses very good techniques to collect and measure data. Their choice of locations was intelligent, especially considering that they demonstrated that work weeks do not make a great deal of difference vs biological clocks. Similarly, trying to cover different cultural differences was great too.  
Based on my outsider interaction with Twitter, in recent times, Twitter has been heavily used to sway public opinion by using massive bot farms to trend topics. I wonder how this kind of bot infestation will affect studies like this, which rely a lot on picking random population samples, across the world.

## Personality, Gender, and Age in the Language of Social Media: The Open-Vocabulary Approach ([Link](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073791&type=printable))

This is a great paper that brilliantly uses large-scale NLP to glean out useful information. The paper aims to study Facebook status updates to understand the correlation between personality types, age and gender and the words that they use to express themselves on social media. In my opinion, this is an important area of study because it can also be used in reverse - looking at someone's status updates can help us understand useful features of their personality and possibly render timely mental health to those in need for example.  
They data collection methods were solid - using status updates rather than surveys and interviews helps understand how people express themselves freely in their day-to-day lives rather than in an ideal situation like an interview. The scale of data collected was massive too - nearly 75000 valid users out of more than 100,000 participants - this truly gives a mind-boggling scale of information to process, across all the different parameters. The only thing that I felt did not fit in properly was the personality assessment. Personality assessments are known to be unreliable, and in general, does not fit in with the paper's theme that inferences were made based on people's free experession rather than a survey.  
But despite these shortcomings, the paper did a great job in identifying relationships between words and age/gender/personalities. The choice of using both close and open vocabulary methods was useful to bring in more context rather than using a rigid set of rules. The word clouds were a great way to present results for this study.  
Even though it has been almost 10 years since this study was undertaken, the results ring true to this day. My experience over time, with age and personality types, has been very close to what the paper suggests, although there seems to be bias towards more American/Western participants in the study. The top words are a great representation of the general vocabulary and the thoughts that dominate individuals across age groups and even gender. Table 5.A gave a great "in a nutshell" representation of the findings across age groups, and it is very close to my experiences. Even the word clouds for gender show a stark and expected difference between thoughts and expression in people across gender.
